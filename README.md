## üîå Writing Plugins

FlexCLI allows developers to create plugins as `.dll` files. Each plugin must include:

1. **An `Info` Class**:
   Contains metadata about the plugin, such as name, version, and author.
2. **A `Main` Class**:
   Responsible for registering commands provided by the plugin.

### Example Plugin

1. **Create a New C# Class Library**:
   ```bash
   dotnet new classlib -n MyPlugin
   cd MyPlugin
   ```

2. **Define the `Info` and `Main` Classes**:

   ```csharp
   using System;
   using System.Collections.Generic;

   // Plugin Metadata
   public class Info
   {
       public static string Name = "MyPlugin";
       public static string Version = "1.0.0";
       public static string Author = "Your Name";
   }

   // Plugin Entry Point
   public class Main
   {
       public static Dictionary<string, Command> Commands = new();

       public Main()
       {
           RegisterCommands();
       }

       private void RegisterCommands()
       {
           Commands["hello"] = new Command
           {
               Name = "hello",
               Description = "Displays a greeting message.",
               Execute = args =>
               {
                   Console.WriteLine("Hello from MyPlugin!");
               }
           };
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Build the Plugin**:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

4. **Install the Plugin**:
   - Locate the `.dll` file in the `bin/Debug/net6.0` folder.
   - Copy it to the `Plugins` directory of FlexCLI:
     ```plaintext
     FlexCLI/
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Plugins/
     ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MyPlugin.dll
     ```

5. **Run FlexCLI**:
   - Start FlexCLI, and the plugin will be automatically loaded.
   - Use `help --cl` to verify that your plugin is loaded.
